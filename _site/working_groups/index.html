        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/working_groups/applied_research.html">Applied Research</a>
        </h2>

        <p>
          The goal of this working group is broad and a catch all for the more technical projects. Scraping judicial websites? Making your own ISP? Let's get crazy and see what happens.
        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/working_groups/bureaucracy.html">Bureaucracy</a>
        </h2>

        <p>
          Goal: keep this committee running.
Managing the volunteer form, keeping the onboarding documentation up to date, verifying membership of applicants and experimenting with tech.dsausa.org as a recruiting tool for the committee. 

        </p>
      </li>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/working_groups/chapter_infrastructure.html">Chapter Infrastructure</a>
        </h2>

        <p>
          The goal of this working group is to make sure that chapters have the IT infrastructure needed to organize. It's a broad goal and will first involve talking to every chapter and seeing what they currently have set up.
        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/working_groups/forum.html">Forum</a>
        </h2>

        <p>
          Goal: get forum.dsausa.org usable, figure out how to organize with it and help roll it out to the general membership over the next few months.
There is a lot of work with discourse, auth0, onboarding other committees and community management to be done here.
Additionally, a code of conduct for the forum (but also all DSA online spaces) needs to be written.

        </p>

      <li>
        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/working_groups/member_data.html">Member Data</a>
        </h2>

        <p>
          The goal of this working group is to make sure the right people have the right data at the right time. This sort of work involves SQL, scripting and reporting tools. A letter of recommendation from your chapter is required to be given access to member data.
        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/working_groups/security.html">Security</a>
        </h2>

        <p>
          The goal of the working group is to make sure that DSA members, chapters and the national organization are secure and can respond to any threats that may arise. A letter of recommendation from your chapter is required to participate in this group.
        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/working_groups/website.html">Website</a>
        </h2>

        <p>
          Goal: make dsausa.org better.
Expect lots of web development and working with stakeholders.

        </p>
      </li>
    
  </ul>

    Want to make your own working group? Ask [us](form:todo) if it fits within the tech committee's purview.
    If it does, then they'll set it up with it's own category and channels and a little blurb in here.
