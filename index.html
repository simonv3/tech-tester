    The DSA Tech Committee puts technology to work for the national DSA office and local chapters so that we can effectively organize and communicate online.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our subcommittees look after DSA’s web presence, defend our digital security and privacy, provide training for the software and online services we use, and dive into research and development when new technology needs arise.
    We can use volunteers up, down, and around the stack.

    Tell us about your skills and interests and we’ll find a place for you to help out.
