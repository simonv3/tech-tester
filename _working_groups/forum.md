title: Forum
description: |
  Goal: get forum.dsausa.org usable, figure out how to organize with it and help roll it out to the general membership over the next few months.
  There is a lot of work with discourse, auth0, onboarding other committees and community management to be done here.
  Additionally, a code of conduct for the forum (but also all DSA online spaces) needs to be written.
meets: Mondays at 8PM EST
